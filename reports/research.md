> Workflow success, fresh data and passed integrity checks are not evidence of a trading edge. Intervals are descriptive; decisions are as-of replays by a 6-hourly lab, not live executions.

## Designs

Signals are kept apart: **Data** is the state of this design's inputs (collection health is in [latest.md](latest.md)); **Integrity** is whether the required inputs of this attempt validated (hourly controls: policy conflicts, stored = labelled); **Publication** is whether this attempt may stand as the current result and, if supported, feed a proposal. `—` = not yet computable (not enough data).
