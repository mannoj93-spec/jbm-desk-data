## Since recovery deployment

Study recovery deployment (PR #53), 2026-10-26T00:58:03Z; commit `d03301c59ec95502e716faf06502c875298a2866`.
Fixed operational comparison by opportunity time, not a reset of research history.

## Diagnostics

Training readiness, per-opportunity reasons and source confirmations, publication delays, pending/overdue scores, per-vintage collection, paired unique-entry sensitivity and options quality are in [the JSON report](market_study_health.json).

Warnings:
- options rr25_7d: 16/23 closed opportunities usable (<80%; quality warning, not a collection outage)
- options rr25_30d: 0/23 closed opportunities usable (<80%; quality warning, not a collection outage)
- 3 retained source-quality incidents; affected score windows are listed without changing results

Paired study: 392 scored forecasts; 324 unique entries; 95 windows in the largest disjoint subset. These are not independent-sample counts.
Sensitivity only: average within each shared entry, then across entries. Overlapping windows remain dependent; no new primary, interval or support claim.

State depth (last_24h): 24 forecasts, 4 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.058333333333334 / 30.9.
- 4: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 30 min before T (limit 30)

State depth (since_deployment): 90 forecasts, 16 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.066666666666666 / 31.116666666666667.
- 7: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 31 min before T (limit 30)
- 9: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 30 min before T (limit 30)

State depth (state_v2_last_24h): 24 forecasts, 0 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.025 / 17.3.

Selected rr25_7d legs: 17 usable captures, 68 leg observations. Quote age median (ms): 5652.0; relative spread median: 0.10084745762711861. Repeated legs and horizons are dependent; missing sizes stay unavailable.

Selected rr25_30d legs: 0 usable captures, 0 leg observations. Quote age median (ms): None; relative spread median: None. Repeated legs and horizons are dependent; missing sizes stay unavailable.

State v2 numerical replay: verified, 62 scores reproduced.

## Source quality

Zero trades and a flat last price are a source-quality anomaly, not proof of an exchange outage. Overlapping windows are not independent. Frozen scores and input eligibility remain unchanged.
- binance_klines_1m_BTCUSDT_perp: 36 flat zero-trade minutes; recovered; 26 overlapping score windows (including dependent arms). Incident binance_klines_1m_BTCUSDT_perp-1793059320000; cross-feed differences in bp: {'spot': 27.71648511836311, 'mark': 23.96204444522043}.
- binance_klines_1m_ETHUSDT_perp: 36 flat zero-trade minutes; recovered; 0 overlapping score windows (including dependent arms). Incident binance_klines_1m_ETHUSDT_perp-1793059320000; cross-feed differences in bp: {}.
- binance_klines_1m_SOLUSDT_perp: 36 flat zero-trade minutes; recovered; 0 overlapping score windows (including dependent arms). Incident binance_klines_1m_SOLUSDT_perp-1793059320000; cross-feed differences in bp: {}.

Separate options expiry pilot: active. [Prospective feasibility report](options_expiry_pilot.md).
