## Diagnostics

Training readiness, per-opportunity reasons and source confirmations, publication delays, pending/overdue scores, per-vintage collection, paired unique-entry sensitivity and options quality are in [the JSON report](market_study_health.json).

Warnings:
None.

Paired study: 141 scored forecasts; 108 unique entries; 40 windows in the largest disjoint subset. These are not independent-sample counts.
Sensitivity only: average within each shared entry, then across entries. Overlapping windows remain dependent; no new primary, interval or support claim.

State depth (last_24h): 24 forecasts, 4 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.09166666666667 / 31.05.
- 3: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 31 min before T (limit 30)
- 1: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 30 min before T (limit 30)

State depth (since_deployment): 27 forecasts, 5 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.1 / 31.116666666666667.
- 4: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 31 min before T (limit 30)
- 1: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 30 min before T (limit 30)

State depth (state_v2_last_24h): 4 forecasts, 0 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.15 / 16.3.

Selected rr25_7d legs: 24 usable captures, 96 leg observations. Quote age median (ms): 4679.5; relative spread median: 0.08695652173913052. Repeated legs and horizons are dependent; missing sizes stay unavailable.

Selected rr25_30d legs: 24 usable captures, 96 leg observations. Quote age median (ms): 4680.0; relative spread median: 0.05555555555555541. Repeated legs and horizons are dependent; missing sizes stay unavailable.
