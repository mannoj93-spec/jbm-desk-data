## Diagnostics

Training readiness, per-opportunity reasons and source confirmations, publication delays, pending/overdue scores, per-vintage collection, paired unique-entry sensitivity and options quality are in [the JSON report](market_study_health.json).

Warnings:
- turnover: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- range: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- state: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- paired: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)

Paired study: 61 scored forecasts; 41 unique entries; 22 windows in the largest disjoint subset. These are not independent-sample counts.
Sensitivity only: average within each shared entry, then across entries. Overlapping windows remain dependent; no new primary, interval or support claim.
