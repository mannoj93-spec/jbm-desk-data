# Market study operational health

Generated 2026-10-26T03:31:17.177Z. Integrity: ok.

Operational diagnostics only; frozen study results and launch clocks are unchanged.
Rolling 24-hour counts include closed deadlines plus five minutes for persistence. Pending outcomes are separate.

Paused: False

## Alerts
- range: 6 consecutive closed opportunities missed

## Diagnostics

Training readiness, per-opportunity reasons and source confirmations, publication delays, pending/overdue scores, per-vintage collection, paired unique-entry sensitivity and options quality are in [the JSON report](market_study_health.json).

Warnings:
- turnover: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- range: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- state: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- paired: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)

Paired study: 46 scored forecasts; 30 unique entries; 19 windows in the largest disjoint subset. These are not independent-sample counts.
Sensitivity only: average within each shared entry, then across entries. Overlapping windows remain dependent; no new primary, interval or support claim.
