## Since recovery deployment

Study recovery deployment (PR #53), 2026-10-26T00:58:03Z; commit `d03301c59ec95502e716faf06502c875298a2866`.
Fixed operational comparison by opportunity time, not a reset of research history.

## Diagnostics

Training readiness, per-opportunity reasons and source confirmations, publication delays, pending/overdue scores, per-vintage collection, paired unique-entry sensitivity and options quality are in [the JSON report](market_study_health.json).

Warnings:
- state: 15/23 recorded closed opportunities abstained in 24h (>20%; operational warning only)
- state: last-24h operational coverage below 80% (not a research threshold)
- options rr25_30d: 15/22 closed opportunities usable (<80%; quality warning, not a collection outage)
- 3 retained source-quality incidents; affected score windows are listed without changing results

Paired study: 1753 scored forecasts; 1521 unique entries; 398 windows in the largest disjoint subset. These are not independent-sample counts.
Sensitivity only: average within each shared entry, then across entries. Overlapping windows remain dependent; no new primary, interval or support claim. Equal minute entry clocks cannot establish a subminute execution or latency advantage.

State depth (last_24h): 24 forecasts, 16 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 30.725 / 30.966666666666665.
- 16: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 30 min before T (limit 30)

State depth (since_deployment): 433 forecasts, 134 abstentions; 3 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 16.05 / 45.85.
- 21: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 31 min before T (limit 30)
- 108: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 30 min before T (limit 30)
- 2: ret_15m_bp: stale-inputs: latest perp bar closed 47 min before T
- 2: rv_1h_bp: incomplete-or-stale
- 2: flow_per_depth: stale-inputs: latest perp bar closed 47 min before T
- 2: d_oi_1h_pct: stale-oi: newest usable OI stamp 55 min before T (limit 45)
- 2: oi_x_ret: stale-oi: newest usable OI stamp 55 min before T (limit 45)
- 1: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 45 min before T (limit 30)
- 1: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 40 min before T (limit 30)
- 1: flow_per_depth: stale-depth: measured 32 min before T (limit 30)

State depth (state_v2_last_24h): 24 forecasts, 0 abstentions; 0 unavailable depth ages. Median/max age in minutes: 15.833333333333334 / 29.65.

Selected rr25_7d legs: 20 usable captures, 80 leg observations. Quote age median (ms): 4983.0; relative spread median: 0.10391363022941974. Repeated legs and horizons are dependent; missing sizes stay unavailable.

Selected rr25_30d legs: 16 usable captures, 64 leg observations. Quote age median (ms): 4892.5; relative spread median: 0.046511627906976626. Repeated legs and horizons are dependent; missing sizes stay unavailable.

State v2 numerical replay: verified, 400 scores reproduced.

State v2 evidence: 400/1680 scored observations for the frozen minimum interval threshold; 2/10 block equivalents. Scheduled review: 2027-04-25T00:00:00.000Z. Block equivalents are not independent samples. Frozen interval and review rules; no automatic promotion.

Immediate selected books: 192 usable / 192 attempted / 192 selected in 24h; median/p90 source lag (ms): 530.0 / 771.
Immediate collector diagnostic, separate from both prospective pilots. Missing and budget-skipped captures are explicit; later sizes never replace original quotes.

## Source quality

Zero trades and a flat last price are a source-quality anomaly, not proof of an exchange outage. Overlapping windows are not independent. Frozen scores and input eligibility remain unchanged.
- binance_klines_1m_BTCUSDT_perp: 36 flat zero-trade minutes; recovered; 26 overlapping score windows (including dependent arms). Incident binance_klines_1m_BTCUSDT_perp-1793059320000; cross-feed differences in bp: {'spot': 27.71648511836311, 'mark': 23.96204444522043}.
- binance_klines_1m_ETHUSDT_perp: 36 flat zero-trade minutes; recovered; 0 overlapping score windows (including dependent arms). Incident binance_klines_1m_ETHUSDT_perp-1793059320000; cross-feed differences in bp: {}.
- binance_klines_1m_SOLUSDT_perp: 36 flat zero-trade minutes; recovered; 0 overlapping score windows (including dependent arms). Incident binance_klines_1m_SOLUSDT_perp-1793059320000; cross-feed differences in bp: {}.
